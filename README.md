This repo contains a notebook and data showing how to correct biases in a sample dataset (demographic_attributes.csv) to better reflect the ground truth distribution provided in a ground truth dataset (demo_ground_truth.csv). This correction ensures that the sample data accurately represents various demographic groups, including age, education, and ethnicity. By calculating and applying weights, we adjust for any discrepancies between the sample and ground truth distributions.
